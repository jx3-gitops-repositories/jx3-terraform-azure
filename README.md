# Azure Terraform Quickstart template

Use this template to easily create a new Git Repository for managing Jenkins X cloud infrastructure needs.

We recommend using Terraform to manange the infrastructure needed to run Jenkins X.  There are a number of cloud resources which may need to be created such as:

- Kubernetes cluster
- Storage buckets for long term storage of logs
- IAM Bindings to manage permissions for applications using cloud resources

Jenkins X likes to use GitOps to manage the lifecycle of both infrastructure and cluster resources.  This requires two Git Repositories to achieve this:
- **Infrastructure git repository**: infrastructure resources will be managed by Terraform and will keep resources in sync.
- **Cluster git repository**: the Kubernetes specific cluster resources will be managed by Jenkins X and keep resources in sync.

# Prerequisites

- A Git organisation that will be used to create the GitOps repositories used for Jenkins X below.
  e.g. https://github.com/organizations/plan.
- Create a git bot user (different from your own personal user)
  e.g. https://github.com/join
  and generate a personal access token, this will be used by Jenkins X to interact with git repositories.
  e.g. https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:user,read:org,user:email,write:repo_hook,delete_repo,admin:repo_hook

- __This bot user needs to have write permission to write to any git repository used by Jenkins X.  This can be done by adding the bot user to the git organisation level or individual repositories as a collaborator__
  Add the new `bot` user to your Git Organisation, for now give it Owner permissions, we will reduce this to member permissions soon.
- Install `terraform` CLI - [see here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli#install-terraform)
- Install `jx` CLI - [see here](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-cli/releases)

# Git repositories

We use 2 git repositories:

* **Infrastructure** git repository for the Terraform configuration to setup/upgrade/modify your cloud infrastructure (kubernetes cluster, IAM accounts, IAM roles, buckets etc)
* **Cluster** git repository to contain the `helmfile.yaml` file to define the helm charts to deploy in your cluster

We use separate git repositories since the infrastructure tends to change rarely; whereas the cluster git repository changes a lot (every time you add a new quickstart, import a project, release a project etc).

Often different teams look after infrastructure; or you may use tools like Terraform Cloud to process changes to infrastructure & review changes to infrastructure more closely than promotion of applications.

# Getting started

__Note: remember to create the Git repositories below in your Git Organisation rather than your personal Git account else this will lead to issues with ChatOps and automated registering of webhooks__.

1. Create and clone your **Infrastructure** git repo from this GitHub Template https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-terraform-azure/generate

    Note: Ensure **Owner** is the name of the Git Organisation that will hold the GitOps repositories used for Jenkins X.

2. Create a **Cluster** git repository; choosing your desired secrets store, either Vault or Azure Key Vault:
    - __Vault__: https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-azure-vault/generate

    - __Azure Key Vault__: https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-azure-akv/generate
    
    Note: Ensure **Owner** is the name of the Git Organisation that will hold the GitOps repositories used for Jenkins X.

3. You need to configure the git URL of your **Cluster** git repository (which contains `helmfile.yaml`) into the **Infrastructure** git repository (which contains `main.tf`). 

So from inside a git clone of the **Infrastructure** git repository (which already has the files `main.tf` and `values.auto.tfvars` inside) you need to link to the other **Cluster** repository (which contains `helmfile.yaml`) by committing the required terraform values from below to your `values.auto.tfvars`, e.g.

```sh
cat <<EOF >> values.auto.tfvars    
jx_git_url = "https://github.com/$git_owner_from_cluster_template_above/$git_repo_from_cluster_template_above"
EOF
```

The contents of your `values.auto.tfvars` file should look something like this ....

```terraform
jx_git_url = "https://github.com/myowner/myname-cluster"
jx_bot_username = "bot_user"
```

4. commit and push any changes to your **Infrastructure** git repository:

```sh
git commit -a -m "fix: configure cluster repository and project"
git push
```

5. Now define 2 environment variables to pass the bot user and token into Terraform:

```sh
export TF_VAR_jx_bot_token=my-bot-token
```

6. Now, initialise, plan and apply Terraform:

```sh
terraform init
```

```sh
terraform plan
```

```sh
terraform apply
```

Connect to the cluster
```
$(terraform output connect)
```
Tail the Jenkins X installation logs
```
$(terraform output follow_install_logs)
```
Once finished you can now move into the Jenkins X Developer namespace

```sh
jx ns jx
```

and create or import your applications

```sh
jx project
```
